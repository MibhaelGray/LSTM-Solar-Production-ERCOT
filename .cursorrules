# CURSOR.md - ERCOT Price Forecasting Project

## CORE PRINCIPLE
**Code ONLY what is explicitly requested. No overengineering. Ask before assuming.**

## PROJECT GOAL
LSTM model for ERCOT West Texas day-ahead price forecasting using wind generation, system load, and natural gas prices. Target: <10% MAPE.

## CODING RULES

### DO
- Write minimal functions that do exactly one thing
- Import only what's needed
- Use simple solutions
- Ask when uncertain

### DON'T (unless requested)
- Add error handling, logging, or validation
- Create utility classes or helper functions  
- Add visualization or progress bars
- Optimize for performance
- Add configuration files

## COMMUNICATION
When uncertain, ask: *"Should I [option A] or [option B]?"*

**Always ask before adding anything beyond the specific request.**

## TECH STACK
**Allowed**: pandas, numpy, tensorflow/keras, scikit-learn, matplotlib (when requested), requests
**Ask first**: Everything else

## DATA NOTES
- ERCOT uses Hour Ending 1-24 (convert to 0-23)
- Negative prices are legitimate market conditions
- Price spikes >$4,000/MWh are normal during scarcity


**Remember: Implement exactly what's asked, nothing more.**
